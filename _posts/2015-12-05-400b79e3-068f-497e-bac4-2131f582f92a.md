AllDogBoots.com is an ecommerce website that sells boots for dogs. Yes, boots for dogs! Before you roll your eyes thinking the idea is totally silly (because it kinda is), they sell more than 1/2 of the dog boots for medical reasons. 

Some dogs have allergies or irritations and need to have their paws covered up to protect themselves. Some owners live in really hot, arrid areas like Arizona and New Mexico and the black pavent is hundreds of degrees and would burn the dog's feet and so the shoes are necessary. And yes, the other 1/2 of the booties are bought by overzealous parents of pets that are babied _way too much_ just because the shoes are ADORABLE!

AllDogBoots.com hadn't updated their blog's look or feel in many years and thought it was about time. They were looking to update the look, feel, and functionality of their dog boot blog so that owners could share their whimsical and emotional stories and lots of cute pictures. These pictures should be shared! 

Web SEO and Design came up with several designs from cartoony to business-like and we settled on a combination that featured the user's photos and made it easy to navigate. 

If you have a dog, go to http://www.alldogboots.com. If you've already got a dog with boots, go take a picure and share it on their new blog http://blog.alldogboots.com.
