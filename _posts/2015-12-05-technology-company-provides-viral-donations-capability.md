Technology Company Provides Viral Donations Capability.

GivePro Donations is built on patent pending technology. Most nonprofits are constantly needing to raise money and are sometimes providing recognition to their donors by placing their name on a plaque, memorial wall, or donor wall. The problem is that for everyone who visits years later, nobody knows who those people were or why they donated. 

Imagine, taking out your phone, scanning the plaque and immediately seeing that donor's video playing for you. They can share who they are, leave a message for family and friends, and encourage to viewer to donate, as well.

Each person that views the video will have the ability to make an additional donation to the nonprofit on behalf of, or memory of, the original benefactor.

Web SEO and Design, a [Delray Beach Web Design Company][0], was hired to design, build, host, and maintain this [nonprofit technology website][1]. Here are some screenshots:
